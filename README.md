# Operator-Management-System
The Operator Management System is a terminal-based Java application developed as part of SOFTENG 281 at the University of Auckland. The project simulates a centralized system that allows administrators to manage tourism and activity operators across Aotearoa New Zealand. It was designed to strengthen object-oriented programming (OOP) skills by applying concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in a practical, real-world style project.

The system enables administrators to register new operators, create activities, and search for existing operators and activities using keywords in their name, type, or location. To ensure authenticity, the project includes location support in both English and te reo MƒÅori, with validation against predefined enums for standardization. Each operator, activity, and review is assigned a deterministic ID to maintain consistency, improve traceability, and prevent duplication.

A major focus of the project is review management. The system supports three different types of reviews: public, private, and expert. Public reviews can be endorsed by administrators, private reviews can be resolved with follow-up responses, and expert reviews allow for image uploads to support their recommendations. Administrators can display all reviews for a given activity, and the system calculates top-rated activities in each location by averaging public and expert ratings.

The entire application is terminal-driven, with administrators interacting through commands such as CREATE_OPERATOR, SEARCH_OPERATORS, CREATE_ACTIVITY, DISPLAY_REVIEWS, and DISPLAY_TOP_ACTIVITIES. Strict message formatting requirements were implemented using the provided MessageCli templates to ensure consistent outputs and to pass all JUnit test cases.

This project provided hands-on experience with software design, modular development, and Git version control while reinforcing the importance of clean code and test-driven development. It reflects a balance between technical accuracy and practical functionality, serving as a comprehensive introduction to developing scalable, maintainable systems in Java.
